# Building Data APIs with GraphQL
#### Get started with the GraphQL query language and runtime for your APIs

**Presenter:** Samer Buna

**Platform:** Safari Books Online Live Training

GraphQL provides a common interface between clients and servers for fetching and manipulating data. It's a query language for clients and a runtime for servers, with the goal of giving clients more power into what data they can ask for, the format of that data, how much of it to fetch, and much more. With client-specified queries, clients can retrieve the flexible data they need from the server using a single smart endpoint. The GraphQL runtime is language agnostic, and there are several implementations available, including a JavaScript reference implementation by Facebook.

Join expert Samer Buna for a hands-on, in-depth exploration of GraphQL. Youâ€™ll learn everything you need to get started with GraphQL, discover why it's necessary for modern web app architecture, and see how it compares to the alternatives. Along the way, you'll explore the theory and design decisions behind GraphQL and all the powerful features that ship with any GraphQL runtime implementation. You'll also learn how to create a simple GraphQL server.
